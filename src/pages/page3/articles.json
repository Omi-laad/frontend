    "content": "Legislative risk, defined as the potential adverse impact resulting from changes in legislation or regulations, poses significant challenges for businesses and investments. This risk arises when new laws, regulations, or government policies are introduced, amended, or repealed, affecting various aspects of an organization's operations, finances, and strategies. Factors contributing to legislative risk include shifts in political priorities, changes in public opinion, economic conditions, technological advancements, and international developments. Industries may encounter legislative risk in areas such as taxation, environmental regulations, labor laws, trade policies, and industry-specific regulations. Effective management of legislative risk entails monitoring legislative developments, assessing their potential impact, and implementing strategies to mitigate risks or capitalize on opportunities. This may involve advocacy efforts, legal consultation, operational diversification, and strategic adjustments to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes.",

The legislation aims to enhance cybersecurity measures and protect sensitive data from cyber threats.\n\nOn August 11, 2023, the Indian Central Government passed its long-awaited Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP). The act borrows its broad definition of personal data from the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and aims to protect data principals and restrict the activities of data fiduciaries.\n\nThe DPDP obligates data fiduciaries to:\n- Only appoint or involve third-party data processors who are obligated to follow DPDP procedures by a legal contract\n- Ensure personal data is complete and accurate before using the data to make a decision that affects the data principal or before participating in the transfer of personal data\n- Implement necessary organizational measures and technical protocols to ensure ongoing compliance\n- Implement reasonable security safeguards and audits to protect personal data and prevent personal data breaches\n- Notify all affected data principals and the Data Protection Board of any and all known data breaches\n- Safely erase and destroy all personal data upon a data principal withdrawing their consent (unless retention of such data is required by law)\n\nIn addition, the DPDP established the Data Protection Board of India and outlined a new class of data fiduciaries. Significant data fiduciaries are organizations determined to pose increased risk based on a government assessment. Organizations determined to be significant data fiduciaries must comply with additional requirements.",

      "content": "During a recent hearing, the Supreme Court refused to grant an early hearing to a petition challenging the ban on wearing hijab in educational institutions. The Court dismissed the plea seeking urgent consideration of the matter. Chief Justice NV Ramana emphasized that examinations are unrelated to the hijab issue and cautioned against sensationalizing the matter. Aishat Shifa, a student at Government PU College in Kundapura, Udupi district, had filed the appeal against the Karnataka High Court's order. Shifa sought permission to wear a hijab matching the school uniform color during exams scheduled to begin on March 28, citing religious beliefs. Despite the ban on hijabs in educational institutions, Shifa insisted on wearing a headscarf in adherence to her religious convictions. The Supreme Court's decision not to expedite the hearing has implications for similar cases across the country.",

The new law is the first cross-sectoral law on personal data protection in India and has been enacted after more than half a decade of deliberations. The key question this paper discusses is whether this seemingly interminable period of deliberations resulted in a “good” law—whether the law protects personal data adequately, and in addition, whether it properly balances, as the preamble to the law states, “the right of individuals to protect their personal data” on one hand and “the need to process such personal data for lawful purposes” on the other.",

LiveLaw has reported that the bench of Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra, who are hearing a bunch of petitions on the Manipur violence, including those by victims of sexual violence, was “aghast” to learn that FIRs have not been registered for nearly three months after some occurrences. The court also learned that only a few arrests had been made in the 6,000 FIRs that have been registered. “Based on the preliminary data, it does prima facie appear that the investigation has been tardy. There has been a considerable lapse between the occurrence and the registration of FIRs, recording of witness statements and even the arrests are few and far between. In order to enable the court to appreciate the entire dimensions of the nature of investigation that is required, we direct the DGP of Manipur to be personally present in the Court at Friday 2 PM and be in a position of answer the queries of the Court,” the apex court observed, according to LiveLaw.",
